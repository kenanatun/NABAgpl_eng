## Team

## Game ideas
- You can't see much
- You're in a labyrinth
- You have a weak light source
- You can hear scary music coming from monsters
- Monsters can also see through darkness, you cannot
- Monsters cannot be directly attacked
- Music boxes can be found + winded
- Some music boxes stop monsters
- Some music boxes repel monsters
- Your candle can be recharged with static torchlights
- When the light goes off you lose after a short time
- Top-down with music volume to indicate audio source distance and some in-map icons to indicate audio source direction
- You have to get out of the maze
